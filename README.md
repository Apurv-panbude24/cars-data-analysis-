Car Data Analysis
Project Description
This project explores and analyzes a dataset of used cars to derive insights and visualize trends in the automotive market. The analysis includes preprocessing the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating visualizations to uncover relationships between features like car prices, mileage, brand popularity, and more.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, making it a valuable resource for data enthusiasts and those interested in the automotive industry.
