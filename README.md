# **Car Data Analysis**

## **Project Description**  
This project explores and analyzes a dataset of used cars to derive insights and visualize trends in the automotive market. The analysis includes preprocessing the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating visualizations to uncover relationships between features like car prices, mileage, brand popularity, and more.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, making it a valuable resource for data enthusiasts and those interested in the automotive industry.

## **Features**  

### **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values.  
- Converting categorical data into usable formats.  
- Normalizing numerical features.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analysis of price trends based on car features (e.g., brand, model, fuel type).  
- Identification of outliers and anomalies.  
- Statistical summary of the dataset.  

### **Visualizations**  
- Correlation heatmaps.  
- Scatterplots and histograms.  
- Boxplots for categorical vs. numerical data analysis.  

### **Insights and Trends**  
- Price distribution analysis.  
- Impact of mileage, age, and condition on car prices.  
- Popular brands and their average pricing.
